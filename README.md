# trackers_app

This project aims to master FLUTTER functionalities such as "flutter_river pod","flutter_provider".
In a friendly and easy-to-use interface, we have managed to implement the CRUD functions (create, read, update and delete) through gestures.
In addition to this, we added the tracking functionality used today 'heatmap' to get an overview of the frequency of use.
